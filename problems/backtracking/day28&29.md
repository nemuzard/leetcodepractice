### Summary 
**Remove duplicates in backtracking** 
1. given vector needs to be sorted
2. a helper vector `used` is needed. Set `used[i]=true` if we add the element to our path
3. if remove duplicates at the same level of the  tree structure, check the condition if `used[i]==false`, which indicates the element has not been used yet but have the same value as the previous one; true otherwise.

**When to collect result** 
-  if we collect results at leaf level, we will have our stop condition and return
-  if we collect results over the entire tree, then a stop condition and return are unnecessary since the return signifies the end of t'he search.

**Tree Structure related to Backtracking**
1. Subset problem
2. Combination (Order does not matter)
3. Permutations (Order matters [1,2] and [2,1] are different)
4. Cutting Problem (eg. Valid Ip Address)
